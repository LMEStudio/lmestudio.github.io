**<center>未来已来。</center>**

Due to our heavy academic pressure, this institute project has been set aside for about 2 years, however, we are here rebuilding it.  

We're still working on it, it's under estimated that the official site will be open to public by *the end of the year*.  

Process:  

- [ ] Rebuilding the website
- [ ] Sort the docs
- [ ] Gathering hands

We will provide:  

1. NOIP & NOI related knowledge base
2. Neural Network & Machine Learning tutorials
3. LM training GUI

And we lacks a hand, so what about joining us? Just simply [email](orangelop@qq.com) us.  

Our plan by the end of the year is this site will provide:  

1. Our Public Cracks Download
2. Tutorial & Docs for LME Public Repository
