# LME Institute Official Site

Introduction to LME Institute:  

* We're a **non-profit** institute which deeply cultivates in computer science and embedded system.  

* We're Chinese and we speak mainly English (mainly for better communications) and accept Simp./Trad. Chinese and a bit of Japanese. And we're a friendly united team which has a shared commons.  

**UPDATE:** Due to our heavy academic pressure, this institute project has been set aside for about 4 years, however, we are here rebuilding it.  

~~We're still working on it, it's under estimated that the official site will be open to public by *the end of the year*.~~  

**UPDATE:** We'll back on track in Jul. 2025.  

Rebuilding Processes:  

- [ ] Rebuilding the website
- [ ] Sort the docs
- [ ] Gathering hands

After that we will provide:  

1. NOIP & NOI (or other algorithm competitions) related knowledge base
2. Neural Network & Machine Learning tutorials
3. CTF tricks (misc, binary, algorithm, web, etc.)
4. Turorials for making a ADX controller (and more rhythm games controllers) from scratch
5. A variety of professional industrial software cracks

And we lacks a hand:  

* So what about joining us? Just simply [email](orangelop@qq.com) us.  

* We need someone who experts in embedded sys., reverse engineering, various programming langs or CTF exp..  

Our plan ~~by the end of the year~~ for the future is this site will provide:  

1. Our Public Cracks Free Downloads and Private Cracks Vault Authorised Access Point
2. Tutorial & Docs for LME Public Repository Free To View and Private Repositories Authorised To Access
